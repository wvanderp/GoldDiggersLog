including but not limited to
```
1 chared body
2 aduld sized bodies
and 6 child sized bodies
```

there is a woman screaming.

a halfling boy is screaming behind some crates.

one of the adults have a [[Zhentarim|snake people]] tatoo on there arm.

one of the gromes is covered in suage like he just came from the sewers

[[Eur Dur]] descovers that this was done by a fireball spell.

the woman saw a sahdowy figure on the roof. it hurled a fireball down.

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] make his way up to the roof and finds a gardener who says that a man ran away after grabbing something from the gnome.

the [[City watch]] swarms to the crimescene and a sargent starts the inverigation.

the woman tell the [[City watch]] that [[Dan Sing]] picked up a bag from one of the victems.
[[Dan Sing]] is forced to pour out the pouch it contains gemstones.

[[Melandor]] offers to help the guard with the investiugation. but a better wizzard is already on its way to investigate.

[[Eur Dur]] takes detailed notes of the situation.

after a small wait two man show up. one of them is a [[city guard]] sargent [[sefph Crumbly]] and the otherone is a wizzard [[Barnabus Blasstwind]].

they bring a buttload of consabols. the sargent taks our eye withness statements.

[[Dan Sing]] asks if we can have the diamonds.
[[melanor]] tels about the kid behind the crate.

the hands a over a beet necklace which melandor knows can cast spels.

[[Barnabus Blasstwind]] and [[sefph Crumbly]] come back with more question and they invite us to investigate the gnome.
we dont recognise the gnome. he does wear a dagger on its side.

the other people also dont know the gnome.

[[Dan Sing]] plays a billoweing preformance with his new cape.

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] pill out the hat and does not give it back.

[[Dan Sing]] and [[Melandor]] get the feeling that the guy on the roof might look like a automaton.
and they go to the festival of automation and the gaunt. to ask around for more infromation.

the others descide to open the hub. and right on thime [[Althaea, Elthaea, Ulthaea|AEU]] float in.
when asked about this morning they state that:
```
