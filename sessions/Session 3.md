We left off in the [[sewers]] after killing the [[gazer]]

[[Dan Sing]] stole the head of the [[gazer]]

There were some good and some bad stealth rolls.

[[Eur Dur]] leads the group in continuing following the tunnels

We find the following map:
![[PXL_20221114_225910154.jpg]]
![[PXL_20221114_175207521.jpg]]

[[Eur Dur]] looks through the arrow slits but sees nothing
[[Isona Silverspeak|Isona]] also looks through an arrow slit but also sees nothing
[[Traris]] looks through an arrow slit but sees nothing

[[Traris]] opens a door. It scrapes open
Behind the door are more rooms

One with a [[goblin]] asleep. We grappled it.
And untied his mouth. It starts screaming

We all stumble into the small room next to the roundabout
We prepare for battle

[[Dan Sing]] intimidates the [[goblin]]
The [[goblin]] is so scared that it pisses his pants

The goblin answers the following

- I don't know how many are coming
- 7 goblins???
- This is a hideout
- [[Grum'shar]] is the boss of the hideout
- Traps???

Then [[Dan Sing]] knocks him out, and the rest of the group starts stealing

We enter the room with the stone pillar.

In the next room, we find

- A half-orc [[Grum'shar]]
- A brain with feet
- A [[mind flayer|tentacle man]] (later learn this is [[Nihiloor]])
- And a [[Floon]]

Roll initiative

[[Isona Silverspeak|Isona]] gets possessed by the brain???
While being Unconscious

[[Eur Dur]] gives her a health potion

After a good fight [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] kills the half orc
And the [[mind flayer|tentacle guy]] portals away
