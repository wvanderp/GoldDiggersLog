[[Traris]] wanted to flee but decided to stay and shoot and killed one of the birds 

One of the birds ran out. I tried to grapple it. But failed, and it was stared down.
"it is very scared."

[[Galadriel]] tries to investigate it. [[Eur Dur]] also tries to find out what happened. But both fail

[[Dan Sing]] find another bird in the doorway, and with a song, it says: 
"[[Xanathar]] sends his regards."

[[Isona]] is very interested in why there are 12 bodies inside, 
"no time to loot the place. Have to take them to the boss."

then [[Isona]] grappled the bird

[[Traris]] asks what they are doing here
"just tied up the guys in the back."

With an eerie quiet outside, both birds are tied up.

Some of the bodies have snake tattoos. Most have no tattoos. one has an eye tatoo

[[Eur Dur]] jumps into the [[sewers]] first. a yellow symbol of an eye greets us 
together with the foul smell of raw sewage
