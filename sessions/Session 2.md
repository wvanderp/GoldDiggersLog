[[Isona]] chickens out and runs outside

[[Traris]] prepares an arrow and shoots. They start running
{{d20|19}} {{D8|8}}

[[Eur Dur]] would like to wack a bird
{{D20|18}} {{D8|7}}

[[Galadriel]] would like plausible deniability and moves further away.

[[Dan Sing]] moves into the cord yard and watches the background

[[Isona]] comes to finish the job that [[Eur Dur]] started
{{D12|12+6}}

[[Traris]] wanted to flee but decided to stay and shoot and killed one of the birds

One of the birds ran out. I tried to grapple it. But failed, and it was stared down.
"It is very scared."

[[Galadriel]] tries to investigate it. [[Eur Dur]] also tries to find out what happened. But both fail

[[Dan Sing]] find another bird in the doorway, and with a song, it says:
"[[Xanathar]] sends his regards."

[[Isona]] is very interested in why there are 12 bodies inside,
"No time to loot the place. Have to take them to the boss."

Then [[Isona]] grappled the bird

[[Traris]] asks what they are doing here
"Just tied up the guys in the back."

With an eerie quiet outside, both birds are tied up.

Some of the bodies have snake tattoos. Most have no tattoos. One has an eye tattoo.

[[Eur Dur]] opens the broom closet and finds [[Renaer Neverember]]

[[Galadriel]] makes a royal entrance

When [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] is asked about [[Floon]] reveals the story of the night

Drinks... home??? Jumped... lost Floon...

Then the [[City Watch|city guard]] enter the premises.

[[Isona]] tries to steal something while the [[City Watch|city guard]] is entering
[[Galadriel]] tries to stop her but fails

The [[City Watch|city Guard's]] [[Captain Staget]] talks to [[Renaer Neverember]] and he explains the situation

[[Dan Sing]] tries to pressure the [[Captain Staget|captain]] to giving us a reward for finding this place
He fails

The [[Captain Staget|Captain]] lets us be

One of the [[female guard|female guards]] notices [[Traris]]. She looks like she knows [[Traris]]. Some members of the group notice.

[[Galadriel]] ask if there's anybody upstairs
NO

[[Dan Sing]] asks [[Traris]] if he knows the girl
He doesn't

After some investigation, we found a paper bird that could send anybody a message.

After looking outside, we find a clue leading us to the [[sewers]]

# [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer's house]]

A long night of investigating, reading and snooping at the house of [[Renaer Neverember]] ends in [[Isona]] picking a lock of the sleeping chambers of the [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] and getting caught by his butler.

After this night of hijinks, [[Isona]] and [[Galadriel]] try to gaslight [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] into firing one of the maids. This annoyed [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]]

Although we used much of [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] goodwill, he will still help us while investigating the sewers

# The [[sewers]]

[[Eur Dur]] jumps into the [[sewers]] first. A yellow symbol of an eye greets us
Together with the foul smell of raw sewage

A line is formed, and a sneaky march is started down the sewer lines.

After following the sewers for an hour, we find a creature.
A big [[gazer|floating eye]] with tentacles.
