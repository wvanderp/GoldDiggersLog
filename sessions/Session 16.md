It is the day of the big opening of [[Hobsens hub]].

all the bar personnel have arrived except for [[Linsy Laugingsteel|Linsy]]

[[Melandor|Melondor]] takes [[Jenks]] and [[Squiddly]] to investigate

[[Dan Sing]] prepairse a imprompto concet with [[three strings]] and [[Traris]] can play the fuite

[[Eur Dur]] remodels one of the shelves and fills it with books.

The pub opens, and many guests join: [[Volo]] and [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]], the person from the bookstore, and someone we met in another bar.

[[Eur Dur]] asks [[Althaea, Elthaea, Ulthaea|AEU]] for the perfect drink. he gets flashbacks to the time when he was a little boy.
He remembers that the path he takes is not the path he desires.

[[Melandor|Melondor]] went to [[Linsy Laugingsteel|Linsys]] house in the [[Sea ward]] to see why she is not at work.
her mom "had a bit of a tumble."

at the pub, [[Old Xoblob Shop|Xoblob]] showed up in a purple suit, and he had a little pouch to collect his purple drink.

when [[Linsy Laugingsteel|Linsy]] finally makes her way into work, [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] snaps at her about how nobody wants to work anymore

[[Eur Dur]] mumbles under his breath:

> It is commonly known that elves don't have mothers

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] hears this and ask [[Eur Dur]] to speak up

He repeats:

> IT is COMMONLY known that ELF don't have MOTHERS they CARE ABOUT

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] does not take this lightly and takes a tankard from the table and tries to hit [[Eur Dur]] with it.

[[Eur Dur]] catches the tankard with one hand and places it calmly on the table.

he calmly tells [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]]:
> I expected more from your sharp thong

[[Eur Dur]] turns around and walks away

when that fight fizzled out, [[Traris]] notices some flames in the kitchen. [[Isgrigg & Dupere]] burned some food because they were bickering about who should watch the food.

After that has been handled, [[Fenora the Mortician]] and the clothmaker show up.

[[Eur Dur]] start to get a little drunk

[[Galadriel I sael|Galadriel]] talks to the [[Family Estelmer|loansharks]], they say that the pub is too low brow for their liking and that it is not exclusive enough

[[Melandor|Melondor]] is intrigued who the woman are and asks [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]].
He informs them that they are `very not single`. [[Melandor|Melondor]] was not interested that way.

[[Dan Sing]] chats up the [[Fenora the Mortician]] and invites her to see more of the "establishment."

[[Melandor|Melondor]] talks to [[Volo]] and [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] about the [[Blue Ally]] located in the [[Sea ward]]
It's a challenging dungeon created by a mage. It contains many riches and treasures.

[[Eur Dur]] has been handing out beers to guests and himself and is currently plastered.
With the few remaining seats, he starts the following Drunken speech:

> I don't HATE elves
> and some of them are good people. I guess
> but when they leave the forest, it's not the best that are leaving
> but that being said. Who wants another round...

[[Melandor|Melondor]] is not amused by the speech and wants to take action. He looks around for bystanders to rile up.

but as he takes an other look at [[Eur Dur]] he notices that he is VERRY drunk

As he approaches to "put me to bed," [[Eur Dur]] exclaims:

> Hey, I love this guy
> He just joined us yesterday, and now we are here in our pub

[[Melandor|Melondor]] and [[Traris]] couch [[Eur Dur]] to his chambers, where he flops onto his bed like a wet sandbag.

while [[Melandor|Melondor]] and [[Traris]] retire for the evening

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] starts inhaling a bottle of liquor
he continues drinking and pushing down his feelings
he last falls asleep in the booth with the second bottle half empty.

when the group wakes up [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] is still in the booth

[[Fenora the Mortician|Fenora]] or [[Fenora the Mortician|Felora]] (or whatever her name would be) make the walk of shame

[[Traris]] is up early to clean
[[Eur Dur]] is still a bit drunk and is definitely hangover

[[Melandor|Melondor]] wakes up in [[Blackstaff student dorm]] and remembers he left a book with a 10-year old (aka [[Jenks]])

Then we hear a large explosion outside

[[Dan Sing]] and [[Melandor|Melondor]] rush outside to investigate
and as [[Dan Sing]] steps outside, the only thing he sees is a blown up [[Jenks#Hobsen|owlbear familliar]]
