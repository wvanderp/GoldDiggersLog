We are still at the [[Hobsens Hub|ghost house]] known as [[Volo|Volo's]] payment.

We are starting to go up the stairs.

[[Eur Dur]] kicks open the door
[[Traris]] looks inside
[[Galadriel]] casts dancing lights

Somebody stealthy strolls up to the house.
He looks for his sister but does not seem to see her
He stays in stealth and moves onto the ground floor

[[Eur Dur]] and [[Dan Sing]] listen for noises but don't hear anything

We all go inside
[[Dan Sing]] transforms into a couch potato

![[Pasted image 20221213215316.png]]

When we listen again, we hear footsteps up the stairs.

We find a man of average stature.

He questions who we are.
We question who he is.

He is [[Arthur silverspeak]]
Searching for his sister [[Isona]]
He last saw her a few months ago in their village

[[Isona]] fled the army
Is he an Intel agent?

Then [[Jenks|a boy]] runs out of the room next door and hides behind [[Eur Dur]].
He has a light-up wand and an owlbear plush.

[[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] make an insight check into [[Traris]]. HE SPOKE THE TRUTH

*roll for initiative*

Ghost-like creatures form from out of the ground.

[[Traris]] shoots an arrow. But it does not ring true like he knows it would

[[Galadriel]] asks [[Jenks|the boy]] if he took anything

               I didn't take nothing.

[[Galadriel]] does not believe him. But he seems to speak the truth.

[[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] takes out a scimitar and hits one ghost, and disengages

[[Dan Sing]] shoots an arrow. His bow makes a musical not when he releases

Then the ghost moves through [[Eur Dur]]. It does not feel good. He makes a constitution check and resists the feeling.

[[Galadriel]] hits one of the monsters

[[Eur Dur]] hits the big ghost with his axe. It evaporates, killing it.

[[Jenks|the kid]] cowers away behind [[Eur Dur]]

[[Galadriel]] and [[Traris]] hit the remaining ghosts

We derive that the boy is called [[Jenks]] he clutches his familiar [[hobbsen]]

[[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] asks [[Jenks]] how to defeat the ghosts

               Just like those ones
               - Jenks

When opening another room, more ghosts appear.

[[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] hits a monster

[[Dan Sing]] does a two-handed backstab.
Natural 20

               You filthy thingy
               - Dan sing


[[Jenks]] says more ghosts are in the house.
He heard that from [[Lif]], the tavern ghost.

Also in the house are [[Ned]] and [[Squiddly]]

They were playing in the tavern with marbles and listening to [[Lif]] about the ghosts

Then we took the time to roast [[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] about his past
He and [[Isona]] are not on the best terms
That is all the time we have for today. We conclude we don't like him yet.

The roast was cut short because the door to the hallway revealed another ghost.

[[Galadriel]] goes the other way and looks through a keyhole of a different door.
She sees the wall.

[[Dan Sing]] and [[Traris]] shoot arrows at the ghost

[[Eur Dur]] throws an axe but misses

[[Galadriel]] shoots an arrow

[[Dan Sing]] shoots an arrow and kills it by saying

               Abducting children. You must be spineless
               (Because it is a ghost, and they don't have spines)
               - Dan sing

Then [[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] insults the party's taste in houses.
[[Dan Sing]] tells him off, `how can you say that when there are children still missing`.

[[Eur Dur]] tries to intimidate a door. It was not scared
Embarrassed by his failure, he tries to chop the door into pieces
The door is very broken and just swings open

We find [[Ned|ned's]] sword

We climb up to the astrology tower we find [[Ned]] up there

[[Ned]] cannot talk, but she knows csl (common sign language)

While [[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] is interested in a hand holding an organ

[[Galadriel]] finds [[Counting to ten for orcs]]. She also finds another ghost.

[[Traris]] shoots an arrow at the ghost

The ghost shoots at [[Eur Dur]] but misses
Instead [[Eur Dur]] hits the thing

[[Traris]] hits the thing with an arrow and kills it

We find another ghost in the opening of the last door on the level.

(The building is rumoured to have 11 ghosts)

Arthur throws his daggers and kills the ghost. They bounce off the bathtub and right back into his hands.

[[Dan Sing]] stats 

               We need to save the children
               -Dan sing
This gives everybody bardic inspiration

[[Ned]] and [[Jenks]] storm into the southern room.
In the room, we see [[Squiddly]] in a soup with more ghosts surrounding him.
Brewing the soup is a [[hag]] 

![[Pasted image 20221213221738.png]]

[[Traris]] and [[Galadriel]] grap [[Jenks]] and [[Ned]] 

[[Eur Dur]] tries to throw [[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] into the room
But instead, he throws out his back

The ghost moves out into the hallway.

[[Eur Dur]] gets charmed by the ghost
