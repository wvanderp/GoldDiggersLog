we are still at the [[haunted house|ghost house]] known as [[Volo|Volo's]] payment.

we are starting to go up the stairs.

[[Eur Dur]] kicks open the door
[[Traris]] looks inside
[[Galadriel]] casts dancing lights

somebody stealthy strolls up to the house.
he looks for his sister but does not seem to see her
he stays in stealth and moves into the ground floor

[[Eur Dur]] and [[Dan Sing]] listen for noices but dont hear anything

we all go inside
[[Dan Sing]] transforms into a couch potato

when we listen again we hear foorsteps up the stairs

we find a man of average stature

he questions us who we are?
we question hem who he is?

he is [[Arthur silverspeak]]
searching for his sister [[Isona]]
he has last seen her a few month ago in there village

[[Isona]] fled the army
he is a intel agent?

then [[Jenks|a boy]] runs out of the room next door and hides bihind [[Eur Dur]].
he has a light up want and a owlbear plushy.

[[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] make a indid check into [[Traris]]. HE SPOKE THE TRUETH

*roll for inishiative*

ghost like creatures form from out of the ground.

[[Traris]] shoots an arrow. but it does not ring true like he knows it would

[[Galadriel]] asks [[Jenks|the boy]] if he took anything

	i didnt take nothing

[[Galadriel]] does not belive him. but he seams to speak the truth

[[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] takes out a skimitar and hit one ghost and disengadges

[[Dan Sing]] shoots an arrow. his bow makes a musical not when he releases

then the ghost moves through [[Eur Dur]]. it does not feel good. he makes a constutation check and resist the feeling

[[Galadriel]] hits one of the monsters

[[Eur Dur]] hits the big ghost with his axe. it eveporates, killing it

[[Jenks|the kid]] cowers away behind [[Eur Dur]]

he heard that from [[Lif]] the tavern ghost.

also in the house are [[Ned]] and [[Squiddly]]

they were playing in the tavarn with marhels and listning to [[Lif]] about the ghosts

then we took the time to roast [[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] about his past

[[Eur Dur]] trows an axe but misses

[[Galadriel]] shots an arrow

[[Dan Sing]] shoots an arrow and kills it by saying

	abducting children. you must be spineless
	(becasue it is a ghost and they dont have spines)
	- dan sing

then [[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] insults the party's tast in houses.
[[Dan Sing]] tells hem off, `how can you say that when there are children still missing`

[[Eur Dur]] tries to intimitade a door. it was not sceard
emberest by his failure he tries to chop the door to peices
