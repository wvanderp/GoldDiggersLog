[[Eur Dur]] makes his way over to the mouten to hide before we all arive to fight the scarecrows

[[Eur Dur]] alarts every guard along the way. he talks to one and ask him what what the best spot in the mountains is to read.
the guard just replies that its dangerous in the hills

when [[Eur Dur]] finaly settels in on top of a hill he opens a cheap book. it will not stay closed. and waits till the reset of the crew shows up

the guards dont seam to pay mutch atention to him.

after some more waiting we notice a red glow further into the field and two [[scarecrow]] come alive.

[[Dan Sing]] shoots a arrow into a tree. to show them who is boss. 

[[Eur Dur]] moves to the location of the [[scarecrow]] but is scared of the [[scarecrow|scarecows]] and is paralysed.

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] goes down (to 0 hp) but gets picked up by [[Traris]] healing word. 

[[Dan Sing]] goes down but gets stabilised by [[Eur Dur]].
