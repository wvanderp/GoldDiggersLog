We go to the [[Blackstaff]], but she does not know anything.
Then we go \[to\] the Library.

[[Eur Dur]] looks through his own books but \[finds\] not any info in there.

[[Galadriel i sael]] likes to remember a book about the [[Stone of Golorr]].

[[Dan Sing]] and [[Melandor]] ask the library, but they still did not find out anything.

[[Linsy Laugingsteel|Linsy]] is working the bar and gives us a fancy letter with the seal of the [[Cassalanter House]], a banker family. It's an invitation for some refreshments.

We think about bringing the kids, but Galadriel is against it.
He and Dansing have a moment with the dinamic three

the butler of [[Family Cassalanter|House Cassalanter]] opens the door
[[Feather Quill]] opens the door; \[he\] thinks it's wonderful he is named after two writing implements.

Two kids come in and Dansing bellows.
Dansing billows his cape.

Galadriel gives the longest introduction.
The lady introduces \[herself\] as [[Ammalia Cassalanter]].

She needs help; she knows about the investigation. \[She\] offers information for the results of the \[mission\].

\[Her\] children are cursed by some [[Asmodeus]] and will die on \[their\] next birthday.

They need to get 1 million dollars (999k + gold), but they are not liquid.
So they are searching for the treasure, and they think that the events around our pub are relevant.

[[Lord Victoro Cassalanter]] shows up.
