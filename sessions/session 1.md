**roll initiative**
[[Traris]]
[[Dan Sing]]
some guys
[[Eur Dur]]
[[Galadriel]]

[[Yara|a female half-orc]] is fighting with a human. At some point, the half-orc knocks out the human, and four of his friends take over the fight. The half-orc, who seemed to be winning, is now losing the fight. The owner of the tavern commands everybody out. The half-orc falls into incontinence

During the fight, [[Traris]] and [[Galadriel]] stay at the table, enjoying a delicious glass of wine. [[Eur Dur|eur]] and [[Isona]] "try" to jump into the action. [[Isona]] gets one and grappes him. While Uer fails at jumping from a table and gets some point in emotional damage. 
[[Dan Sing]], who was watching from the first floor while playing a "fighting" song

The half-orc is part of the [[Zhentarim]]. The humans were from the [[Xanathar]].

Eur slaps one of the guys while they run away.

*end of combat*

While everybody is cheering for the "victory" of the half-orc. A sound comes from the yawing portal. And be for we can even prepare for a fight a troll crawls over the edge of the portal.

The elves join the fight for the first time by drawing an arrow and delivering a deathly blow by missing the target and jumping behind the bar.

[[Isona]] also decides to join the fight by fleeing

The bats launch towards the bar with [[Traris]] and [[Galadriel]] behind it. Galadriel jumps up from behind the bar and fires an arrow that sends one of the bat creatures to death.

[[Eur Dur]] throws a hand-axe, and it was very inefficient 
[[Galadriel]] sends a flaming arrow, and it was very effective

[[Isona]] runs back into the bar

[[Traris]] was is inspired by [[Galadriel]] cool move and fires a flaming arrow of its own.

[[Dan Sing]] tries to save his bard friend but misses

Then the barkeep draws his mighty sword and slashes the troll. And it dies falling back into the well. 

[[Eur Dur]] is "inspired" by the display and throws his second hand-axe... the hand-axe misses

[[Galadriel]] destroys the bat on the strings with a critical role

[[Isona]] tries to slash with her shortsword and kills the last bat

*end of combat*

After the fight, the party gathers their arrows and axes. Eur finds only one.


Then a man walks up to the group. "be they adventurers " he asks. And we say 'yeah'. [[Galadriel]] buys us all drinks, and we sit down at a table

[[Volo]] asks us to look for his friend [[Floon]]. he was last seen drunk in the [[Skewered Dragon]] in the dock ward.

What does [[Floon]] look like:

- home [[Human]] male
- early 30ths
- red wavy long hair
- sharp dresser

After not too long deliberation and consulting with [[Bonni]]. The group accepts the offer of [[Volo]] with the knowledge we might not get our promised 100 gold.

For [[Galadriel]], the noble of the group, the first logical step is to hire some children to find him.

After grilling [[Yara]] for some information and getting rejected, we finally leave the [[Yawning Portal]]

# to the [[Skewered Dragon]]

We make our way to the skurewerd dragon. complete with lute music
we also take a detour to get some not-so-fancy clothes for [[Galadriel]], who is afraid to stand out

While walking, we come across a street filled with bodies. All of them have eyes on their forehead.
We keep walking in a bad neighborhood.

# in the [[Skewered Dragon]]
[[Isona]] tries to find some information with her womanly charms. But finds that a few coppers work better.

[[Floon]] was here drinking with [[Renaer Neverember]], and they left together

[[Renaer Neverember]] is the son of the old king of waterdeep


Some other people also followed them out. Those people are known to frequent a warehouse with a snake. The sign of the [[Zhentarim]].

# in [[Old Xoblob Shop]]

In [[Old Xoblob Shop]], there is an old gnome into purple stuff. After being bribed by some of [[Dan Sing|Dansing's]] purple buttons, he suddenly remembers a lot about the evening.

he saw the two read heads being kidnapped by the [[Zhentarim|snake peope]]. And he was taken in the direction of the warehouse.

# near the warehouse

Slowly a plan is formed.

eighter
- kick in the door
- or sneak in

We chose to sneak in (the door can always be kicked in). It went very well but then [[Isona]] got caught
