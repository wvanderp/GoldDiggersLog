[[Melandor]] strolls up and asks what’s up.

[[Eur dur]] tries to scale the wall but fails miserably and looks like a turtle.

[[Traris]] opens the door to the diner. There are 2 persons \[who\] are waiting \[on\] either side of the door. One misses and the other hits.

[[Traris]] then shoots an arrow at them.

Then [[Galadriel]] skewers one of the guys.

[[Dan sing]] casts Heat Metal on the guy's mace and \[he\] drops it.

[[Traris]] then slices the other guy.

We hear metal clinging upstairs.

[[Dan sing]] goes up the stairs.

[[Dan sing]] walks to the middle of the fighting group of guards and bandits and casts Thunderclap, and many get thrown back.

The guards kill most of the other bandits.

[[Galadriel]] goes for the wine cabinet.

And [[Eur dur]] checks the throne room but finds nothing of value.

The big bandit kicks in the door and goes inside, and we hear screams.

[[Traris]] kills the big guy.

[[Dan sing]] goes in\[to\] the rest room and finds the owner of \[the\] house and superheats his weapon, and he drops it.

[[Melandor]] moves in\[to\] the room and attacks with Shocking Grasp.

The guards rush into the room.

[[Galadriel]] inspects the wines \[and\] picks one of the best ones. It’s from the same \[place\] where we did a wine tasting.

The lord is cowering in the corner.

More people come in through the balcony.

Incoming.
