The [[Family Cassalanter]] is interested in combining.

They are interested \[in\] finding the [[Stone of Golorr|stone]] and thus the [[Dragon Hoard]].

The [[Family Cassalanter |family]] reveals that the stone is with a certain [[Louza]].

We decide on a 50/50 split of the [[Dragon Hoard]].

We check the contract and it seems all good.

[[Eur dur]] was not allowed to sign in blood; [[Dan sing]] creates a beautiful one.

[[Orond Gralhund|lord Gralhund]] is linked to the figure that was spotted on the rooftop.

More [[nimblewright]] assailants were spotted stealing the stone.

Their House is close to [[Hobsens hub]].

They are hired swords and \[have\] weapons.

**(Map Diagram Notes)**

* The map shows a layout of a compound or house.
* There is a main gate leading into a courtyard.
* The building has a 1st Floor and 2nd Floor.
* Features include a balcony, an entrance, and a guard entrance plus stables.
* There is a movement path drawn on the left side.

[[Dan sing]] spots people moving on a roof opposite, casing the place.

Also, [[Dan sing]] spots some [[gazers]].

The other group also spots some more people casing the place.

The [[Gold Diggers]] huddled in the middle of the street and decide on storming the House.

We look up the [[gazers]] and find out what they do.

[[Dan sing]] starts making noise to attract the attention of the guard.

There seem to also be horses in the guard house.

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] tries the staff door.

The pantry contains two corpses.

One is a Halfling cook \[and\] the other \[is a\] Human butler.

In the Main Hall there are more bodies: 8 guards \[and\] 2 bandits.

There are 2 more bandits standing in the room; they immediately spot [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]], who opened the door.

[[Traris]] opens the other door: the kitchen. There is a window to the outside.

[[Traris]] calls out for help.
