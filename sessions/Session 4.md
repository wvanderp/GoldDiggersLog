We are in the [[sewers]] about to leave...
or take a short rest...
or exploring more...
or leaving...

after some healty descussion we decide on leaving
we follow the [[sewers]] back and find a random stairs up

[[Isona]] makes a steath check to peak trough the sewer cover
she sees a basement
[[Traris]] also takes a look and hears sounds of a tavern

[[Isona]] goes up and peaks out the the door. she reports back that we are in a fancy tavern

[[Dan Sing]] recognices the tevern as the [[Spouting Fish]] 

[[Dan Sing]] prepairs a big entrance number 
after the lute music starts every character makes a big entrance into the main tavarn room

[[Galadriel]] makes a royal entrance. while [[Traris]] is more reserved. they both sit a the same table

[[Isona]] walks out and picks diffrent table

[[Eur Dur]] uses jazz hands and jazz hands straght out of the door

lastly [[Dan Sing]] comes out and explains the situation to the bar keep.
he tells about the [[goblin]] infastaion and show the [[gazer]] head we slain right at the bottom of the stairs

the bar keep sends for the [[City Guard]] and [[Captain Staget]] awnsers the call. 
first thing we do is haggle him for mony (see also [[Session 2#Zhentarim hideout|our andventur in the zhentarim hidout]])

we explain to him about the walking brain and the [[mind flayer|tentacle monster]]

[[Captain Staget]] sends for guards to check out the [[sewers]]

# celibrations at the [[Yawning Portal]]

after we cleaned our selfs at a bath house, we walk to the [[Yawning Portal]] to retrive our loot and also delever [[Floon]]

we talk to [[Volo]] and "he says he aint got no money"
but he has a [[haunted house|house]] 

![[Pasted image 20221115225659.png|200]]

the first reaction is one of but we like money.
and why would we need a house if we are staying at [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer's]] 

at this moment we found out that we were not welcome any more at [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer's]]

> you are not staying at my place
> \- [[Renaer Neverember]]

[[Galadriel]] feld very ivided and intitaled to [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer's house]]
but [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] had to insised on not letting us stay

we decide to visid the house in the moring

[[Dan Sing]] reads the room and orders beer for every one
rescued kidnapees and dirty adventures

in the tavern many beers are drunk 
but [[Galadriel]] could not keep her mind of the [[mind flayer]]
[[Eur Dur]] is always up for a trip to the liberary so they go and research

# to the liberary

![[ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif|150]]

[[Eur Dur]] procedes to flip trough [[Volo's Guide to Monsters]]
and quickly finds what he is looking for

he finds that the monster could be a [[mind flayer]]
a moster that eats brainz 

[[Galadriel]] finds out that ther are many news paper clipings about murdered people missing there brains 

there seam to be more [[Zhentarim|snake people]] victems then [[Xanathar|eye people]] 

# back at the [[Yawning Portal]]

many drinks where drunk. everybody was plastered
[[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] got the worst of it 
after some more drinks the party decides that its time to go to bed

the next morning the party rizes late and hung over.
there is only one thing on there mind:
did [[Volo]] skip town or is he giving this house away

so we geather outside his door and try to wake him. no sucsess.
knoking down the door is also no option because it would cost 500 gold pices

so when we were unsucessfull in waking him we went downstairs and waited for him

[[Isona]] and [[Galadriel]] follow [[Volo]]. but when [[Galadriel]] gets upto follow
