We are in the [[sewers]] about to leave...
Or take a short rest...
Or exploring more...
Or leaving...

After some healthy discussion, we decide on leaving
We follow the [[sewers]] back and find a random stair up

[[Isona]] makes a stealth check to peek through the sewer cover
She sees a basement
[[Traris]] also takes a look and hears the sounds of a tavern

[[Isona]] goes up and peaks out the door. She reports back that we are in a fancy tavern.

[[Dan Sing]] recognizes the tavern as the [[Spouting Fish]] 

[[Dan Sing]] prepares a big entrance number 
After the lute music starts, every character makes a big entrance into the main tavern room.

[[Galadriel]] makes a royal entrance. While [[Traris]] is more reserved. They both sit at the same table.

[[Isona]] walks out and picks a different table

[[Eur Dur]] uses jazz hands and jazz hands straight out of the door

Lastly, [[Dan Sing]] comes out and explains the situation to the barkeep.
He tells about the [[goblin]] infestation and shows the [[gazer]] head we slain right at the bottom of the stairs

The barkeep sends for the [[City Watch]], and [[Captain Staget]] answers the call. 
The first thing we do is haggle him for money (see also [[Session 2#Zhentarim hideout|our adventure in the Zhentarim hideout]])

We explain to him about the walking brain and the [[mind flayer|tentacle monster]]

[[Captain Staget]] sends for guards to check out the [[sewers]]

# Celebrations at the [[Yawning Portal]]

After we cleaned ourselves at a bathhouse, we walked to the [[Yawning Portal]] to retrieve our loot and also deliver [[Floon]]

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
We talk to [[Volo]], and "he says he ain't got no money."
But he has a [[haunted house|house]] 
=======
we talk to [[Volo]] and "he says he aint got no money"
but he has a [[Hobsens hub|house]] 
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

![[Pasted image 20221115225659.png|200]]

The first reaction is, "but we like money."
And why would we need a house if we are staying at [[Renaer Neverember| Renaer's]] 

At this moment, we found out that we were not welcome anymore at [[Renaer Neverember| Renaer's]]

> You are not staying at my place
> \- [[Renaer Neverember]]

[[Galadriel]] felt very invited and entitled to [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer's house]]
But [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] had to insist on not letting us stay

We decided to visit the house in the morning.

[[Dan Sing]] reads the room and orders beer for everyone
Rescued kidnapped and dirty adventures

In the tavern, many beers are drunk. 
But [[Galadriel]] could not keep her mind of the [[mind flayer]]
[[Eur Dur]] is always up for a trip to the library, so they go and research

# To the library

![[ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif|150]]

[[Eur Dur]] proceeds to flip through [[Volo's Guide to Monsters]]
And quickly finds what he is looking for

He finds that the monster could be a [[mind flayer]]
A monster that eats brainz 

[[Galadriel]] finds out that there are many newspaper clippings about murdered people missing their brains 

There seem to be more [[Zhentarim|snake people]] victims then [[Xanathar|eye people]] 

# Back at the [[Yawning Portal]]

Many drinks were drunk. Everybody was plastered
[[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] got the worst of it 
After some more drinks, the party decides it's time to go to bed.

The following day the party rises late and hungover.
There is only one thing on their mind:
Did [[Volo]] skip town, or is he giving this house away

So we gather outside his door and try to wake him. No success.
Knocking down the door is also no option because it would cost 500 gold prices.

So when we were unsuccessful in waking him, we went downstairs and waited for him.

[[Isona]] and [[Galadriel]] follow [[Volo]]. But when [[Galadriel]] gets up to follow 
But when [[Galadriel]] gets up to follow [[Volo]], he sits back down again in protest.
It's clear he does not like [[Galadriel]]

After some yelling, [[volo]] takes floon with him. But leafs [[Galadriel]] behind

# Two tails

A group goes to [[Old Xoblob Shop]] to buy some purple items
[[Dan Sing]] buys the bulk of the inventory

From here, the party splits up. The following accounts should be interwoven but are split for your pleasure:

First [[Isona]]

[[Isona]] follows [[Volo]], but he does what he said he would do.
He went home to get the deeds of the house.

[[Isona]] goes back to the [[Yawning Portal]] to check on [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]].
But she makes some moves on him
And they drink a LOT

And when he passes out in his chambers, she says

	Your flesh will serve nirloor

Then the party:

[[Galadriel]] goes and meets a friend

When the party reaches [[Volo| volo's]] house, a storm is brewing in the air.
A ghostly sprite is seen behind the window.

[[Eur Dur]] burst through the door and rolled into the building

[[Galadriel]] picks up a doll. A ghost comes out, and it attacks [[Galadriel]]

[[Galadriel]] gets hit for 1hp and loses 1 max hit point

[[Dan Sing]] looks at the bar, and in the dust, gets written 

	Last call

[[Traris]] wanders in, sees the ghost, and shoots an arrow at it doing nine damage.

[[Eur Dur]] hits it with its axe and accident cleaves it in half

The doll looks like a child's doll.

	We will take care of her.

The doll says

On the hearth in the dust, it says

	Closing time

[[Dan Sing]] rolls the ball, and a clock sounds

Upstairs we hear a mad kakaling laugh and a scream.

Everybody rushes upstairs
