at fers [[Dan Sing]] tries to convince [[Eur Dur]] to join his plan. but after a bad disguse [[Eur Dur]] is no convinced to contiue with this plan.

[[Traris]] finds a trail to the [[Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery|fancy farm]].

back at the [[Stoutfellow Farm]] farm [[Dan Sing]], [[Traris]], [[Eur Dur]] and [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] disucs there adventures.

we all then noticed that [[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] is gone. but [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] knows that he went to see the [[Blackstaff]].

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] tries to play the [[Stoutfellow Farm]].
she wanted to buy a barral of wine. by first lowballing and then by intimidating the stoutfellows.
they are now scared of [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] but she secured a deal for 42 gp per barrel.
but then [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] relised that all wine sales go trought the [[alcohol guild]] and that you cant buy from the wineries directly.

## the "death" of Arthur

we switch to [[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] who has a "date" with the [[Blackstaff]]. but he for got he had this meeting and is now literly running late.

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] decides to take a short cut and while walking trough a small and dingy ally, a crossbow bold hits hit in the shoulder
(providing with 10 damage)

he sees a lot of enemies and he starts running (full speed + action dash + bonus action dash)

he tries to hid in a box but its nailed shut. he looks for a lader but fails to find anything.

then he tries to hide behind the box. the thugs walk straght past him.

one of the thugs gets hit by an other crossbow arrow and others get hit by normal arrows.

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] stays hidden behind the crate. he sems hidden for a other round.

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] sees some people with insignia of a half moon and harp (imaged below)

![[harperLogo.png|400]]

as the fight contiues some of the tugs bear the sign of the [[Xanathar|eye people]]

as the fighting dies down [[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] tries to slip out. but he is caught by one of the [[Harpers|harp people]].

the harp people says "Arthur don't go anywhere. we are here to help you"

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] meets with miss [[youkijama watdan]]. he is part of the [[Harpers]]

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] gets invited to join the [[Harpers]] guild and meet the big boss

there are some rumours of [[naniatha lhuritstar]] being a double agent.

the [[Harpers]] fake [[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthurs]] death. because he accepts the secret mission to follow the double agent and joint the harpers

is this the last we will see from [[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]]?

## Snowbeatle farm

we return to [[Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery]] were the finest wine is 15 GP a bottle and there is no 1 GP wine. a mult is 8 cp.

we invite lady snobeatle to make a business deal. we persuade her to bing a sample of a fine bottle of wine.

[[Dan Sing]] goes up to the bar "drunk" and gets served water

[[Eur Dur]] tastes the wine it taste like:

```
ginger with eurthy notes
the after tast is light on the toung
the grape is camabar souvogion
```

[[Dan Sing]] gets the attention of the bouncer and throws up into he bathroom because of a sniff of [[camabert]].

then a other wine is served.

```
passion fruit with a oak barrel made witha sovion blank grape
```

[[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] likes to make a "buisness" deal by offering 30 gp for a 90 gp bottle. angering miss snowbeatle in the process.

we get trown out of the snow beatle farm while provusely appologising to miss snobeatle.
