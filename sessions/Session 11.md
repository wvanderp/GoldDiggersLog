she wanted to buy a barral of wine. by first lowballing and then by intimidating the stoutfellows. 
they are now scared of [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] but she secured a deal for 42 gp per barrel.
but then [[Galadriel i sael|Galadriel]] relised that all wine sales go trought the [[alcohol guild]] and that you cant buy from the wineries directly.

## the "death" of Arthur
we switch to [[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] who has a "date" with the [[Blackstaff]]. but he for got he had this meeting and is now literly running late.

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] decides to take a short cut and while walking trough a small and dingy ally, a crossbow bold hits hit in the shoulder 
(providing with 10 damage)

he sees a lot of enemies and he starts running (full speed + action dash + bonus action dash)

he tries to hid in a box but its nailed shut. he looks for a lader but fails to find anything.

then he tries to hide behind the box. the thugs walk straght past him.

one of the thugs gets hit by an other crossbow arrow and others get hit by normal arrows.

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] stays hidden behind the crate. he sems hidden for a other round.

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] sees some people with insignia of a half moon and harp (imaged below)

![[harperLogo.png|400]]

as the fight contiues some of the tugs bear the sign of the [[Xanathar|eye people]] 

as the fighting dies down [[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] tries to slip out. but he is caught by one of the [[Harpers|harp people]]. 

the harp people says "Arthur don't go anywhere. we are here to help you"

[[Arthur Silverspeak|Arthur]] meets with [[youkijama watdan]]. he is part of the [[Harpers]]

[[arthur]] gets invited to join the [[Harpers]] guild and meet the big boss

there are some rumurs of [[naniatha lhuritstar]] beeing a double agent.
