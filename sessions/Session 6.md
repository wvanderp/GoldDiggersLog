We start the session in the boiler room with a [[hag]] preparing some teething soup

We finish the session both going to the courthouse and to [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer's]] house

Hobson's hub

We go to a fancy bookstore.

We went to the black staff tower.

[[galadriel]] tries to hit on the [[Blackstaff]] and fails

Went to a guy in the mountain

[[Traris]] gets approached by a cat and gets asked to join a druid cult

The cat likes [[Arthur silverspeak|Arthur]] more then [[Dan Sing]]

On the mountain, we meet a monk called Halam
The guy has weird vibes
He has a vision of weird shit

Then we went back to the black staff
And joined the [[Gray Hands]]
