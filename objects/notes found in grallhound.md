From our last D&D session, you found a bunch of papers on the desk in the villa.
These are the most interesting pieces you noticed:

(Current year: 1492 DR)

[Diary entry]
Uktar 4th, 1491 DR
They have treated us like fools. In the wake of the [[Lord Murders]] {an event where lords are murderd??}, with so many vacancies among the Lords and with [[Yalah Galhound|Yalah’s]] {miss gralhound} lineage, it should have required no effort at all for her to be elevated to her rightful place. For the [[Gralhund Family]] to be elevated to their rightful place, so that she could guarantee the prosperity of the [[Gralhund Family]] for future generations. Instead they have taken our money. They have taken our favor. And they have spat in our faces. They have closed their ranks against us once again.

[Diary entry]
Nightal 21st, 1491 DR
At the [[fires of Simril]] {winter festival} last night, [[Lord Berenger]] spoke to me of a curious matter. [[Neverember’s Enigma]]. It seems that the former [[Open Lord]] kept some monstrous secret, and now word of that secret is beginning to spread. There are those who believe a [[Grand Game]] may be beginning. I sense in this an opportunity to right the great wrong which has been done to [[Yalah Gralhund|Yalah]].

[Note]
We’ve identified the gnome who’s been keeping surveillance on [[Renaer Neverember|R.N.]] [[Dalakhar]]. An agent of [[Dagult Neverember|Lord D.]] {Dagult Neverember} Please advise.

[Note]
Dal. must still be acting under the orders of [[Dagult Neverember|Lord D.]] {Dagult Neverember} No other explanation for the sudden shift of allegiance.

[Note]
There are Three Eyes with which [[Neverember’s Enigma]] may be seen. The First Eye is held by [[Xanathar]], and lies somewhere within his lair. [[Bulette|Bulette’s]] report that this lair can be accessed from teleportal sites within [[Xanathar|X’s]] sewer hideouts provides a potential means by which this Eye could seized, but in the absence of a synchronized key these teleportal sites are useless.

[Note]
The Second Eye has almost certainly been taken from [[Lord D.]] Mansion by the [[Zhentarim]]. It is more important than ever that we discover where M has hidden his head.

[Note]
[[Xanathar|Xanatharians]] are riled. Word on the street is that something was stolen from them. But not the First Eye. The [[Stone of Golorr]].

[Note]
What if the “Key to Neverember’s Enigma” which [[Xanathar]] was known to hold in his possession is not, as I have suspected, the Eye? But instead the [[Stone of Golorr]]? If so, then what better thief than an [[agent of Dagult’s]]? Perhaps even sent there for that purpose. The gnome has taken the Stone, I am certain of it. If we can find [[Dalakhar]], then we can seize the Key. We can take the Stone.
