## backstory

race: mountain dwarf

class: fighter

### backstory

I come from a small mining town near the same mountain range Waterdeep is located on. Most of the dwarfs there work in the mine. My parents bucked that trend. My father is a blacksmith, and my mother is a weaver.

When I was just turning 25 years old (about 11 human years), a wizard traveled through the town and showed me what knowledge could do by performing what seemed like miracles in the town square.

When the wizard left, I started collecting all the knowledge available to me, which wasn't much because most of the town's folk in the town didn't concern themself with such nonsense. Sometimes a merchant would come to town, which after repeated requests, brought some light literature for me to buy.

In my late twenties, my parents discovered I had no talent for either weaving or blacksmithing. And I found that this town was a dead end for my quest to be just as cool as the wizard I met in my youth. But to everybody's surprise, I did have talent in the way of the axe.

So I started training with the village guard to protect the village. They taught me to fight and to have patience. But it also made me wary of anything foreign.

When I turned 30, I decided to leave my home village â€” partly encouraged by my friend who was kicked out of the village after a big brawl.

My destination was the biggest city nearby, which was Waterdeep. In the first part of the journey, we went together. But when we arrived at Waterdeep, my friend was attracted to bigger opportunities up the coast and left with the promise of big money.

This left me alone in Waterdeep while I quickly found a home in the {{tavern where we started}}. It still left me in an unknown environment.

In the few weeks I have been staying in Waterdeep, I found some public libraries with more knowledge than I could ever consume. But either because it was unavailable or I couldn't find it, I didn't make much progress in becoming a wizard.

### Why do I need the party?

Physically I'm very strong. I can both take and deliver a beating. But emotionally, the transition is tough for me. The city has much to offer if you are courageous or brutal (brutaal) to take it. But I'm too shy and (frightened by the city) to make the most of it.

## What are my life ambitions?

My life's ambition is to become a wizard who is just as cool as the wizard that I remember.

When that is done, I want to share this knowledge by building a library or research institution.

Out of the game: the player is planning to take Eldridge Knight at level 3 so that the character becomes the beginning of a wizard.

## What Do I Know about the Wizard?

I was a little kid when I met him. While it was one of the best things that happened to me, it was also something that was Not burned into my mind. I remember it through the lens of a child's memory/fantasy.

This means that the whole encounter is not that clear to me. I remember the wizard as awesome but were the actions of the wizard received well in the community? Did he help the people he was talking to? Did I see everything that happened? Was this a good helpful wizard or an evil wizard?

In my mind, there is no doubt that the wizard was pure or heard. in reality, I could not judge his character for the few times I saw him around the village

Although I did not catch the wizard's name, I would recognize his robe and staff when I saw them again and connect the face from there.

His staff was made of dark hardwood. Along the sides of the staff, runes were engraved and filled with white filler. Although I can't remember the runes, I now recognize them as such

## How did I meet?

**Bonnie**

Because I am a long-term guest at the {{tavern we start at}}, we meet frequently. She is very supportive of my goals and gives me advice and encouragement each morning. She is the only reason I got anything done at all.

**Dan Sing**

He often plays at the {{tavern we start at}}. Although we don't often speak, I respect his art but think my work is more important.

Game play opportunity: he can come to me with rumors of the gold and is in dire need of a researcher.

## What do I look like?

When I walk into the room, the first question people ask is: is that dwarf wearing the backpack, or is the backpack wearing that dwarf. This is because I took all the books I had with me everywhere I went.

I'm wearing chainmail armor, but the only reason you know is by the sound I make because I always wear some regular clothes on top.

On one side of my backpack is a special strap for my battle axe; on the other, there are some throwables like smaller axes, knives, or a book I dislike.

Although my beard is not that well maintained, I do try because I noticed that people react better when I look propper.
