Once upon a time in a land far, far away, 
There lived a tribe of orcs so strong and brave.
They loved to count and learn new things each day,
But sometimes numbers could be such a maze!

One orc named Grishnak was determined to find, 
A way to help his friends and make them shine.
So he sat down and thought and pondered in his mind,
And soon he had a plan to help them all unwind.

"Orcs," Grishnak said with a big smile on his face,
"We must learn to count and keep up with our pace.
But don't worry, my friends, I have a plan in place,
To help us all learn and have fun with this race."

Grishnak then led the orcs through the forest,
Showing them each number as they went along.
He taught them how to count with their toes and their fists,
And soon the orcs were counting with glee and delight.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, Nine, ten,
we're counting now, it's not too late!
Orcs can learn and have fun, it's not a fate, 
We'll all be experts at counting in no time, just wait!

The orcs continued to learn and grow each day,
Thanks to Grishnak and his clever way.
They counted numbers high and low, fast and slow, 
And soon they were experts at counting, don't you know.

So if you're an orc and you're feeling a bit lost, 
Just remember Grishnak and the counting he taught. 
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, Nine, ten, 
now you know how to count, it's great!
