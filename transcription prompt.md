Try to put the story in the correct order, even if the images are out of order. There should be page numbers on the tops of the images to help with this.

Use \[\] to indicate missing words to make complete sentences.
when something is really unreadable just put \[unreadable\] in its place.
All square brackets need to be escaped with a backslash
do correct my spelling and grammar where needed to make complete sentences.
Also, correct the writing of character names if needed.

Please don't include any information in the document that isn't in the images, as I don't want to be spoiled for the story.
